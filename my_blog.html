            <h3>EDUCATION &  <span class="blog">LIFE</span> </h3>
            <p class="para">Every student is born as a human being first. But have we ever thought about whether we are really living the life a human being should live or not? <br>
                Since the beginning of our academic life from the school, we've always been running after academic excellency. Competitive mentality has changed the entire structure of our education method as well as the objectives of being educated.<br> 
                Achieving brilliant results in exams, to say more clearly, getting GPA-5 or Golden A+ has been all about our aim of taking education.<br>
                 Empty fields scream out because of the lack of fickle children. Bunches of buddies have forgot or given up roaming around together or inebriating tea-stalls in confabulation. This should not be a life where we have kept no room for our present days but all for the future though we don't know if tomorrow comes or not. Yes, academic excellency is one of the most important thing of our life, but we have to remember one thing that education is a part of our life but education is not our life.<br>

                    Social Media - 
                    <span class="blog">is that a blessing or curse for us?</span> </h3>
                    <p class="para">Social media is a communication system where people from every corner of the world meet one another online to be connected with new allies and stay in touch with the old ones. This can obviously be considered as a great blessing of the modern science. But are we turning this blessing into a curse?
                        There are a number of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and so on that are meant to be used for a sort of recreation and meeting new people. But we have taken these mediums in a stage where the benison has become a new form of addiction. We can't stay long without being online. This addiction is making us go apart from the world of reality. Dependence on virtual life has increased so much that it is leading us to a society where we don't like to make time for the real life. As a result, we are getting separated from our actual and tangible friends, the connection among family members is becoming poor and we are being psychologically sick unconsciously.
                        However, to make us slaves of social media sites which are currently acting in the structure of the master was not the intention of the inventors. It is still possible to get the most beneficial and best result of using social media if we can manage to be online for a limited period of time daily and make enough room for the real life. Fortunately the opportunity comes to us to decide whether we choose to be blessed or not. Now what do you think about yourself - blessed or cursed?
